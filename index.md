Fusion welding and additive manufacturing technology has already penetrated into many military and people's livelihood fields, such as aerospace, weapon equipment, ship and marine engineering, new energy and new materials, nuclear equipment, automobile and rail vehicles.At present, there are some on-line measurement devices for molten pool at home and abroad, but they are mainly based on single physical quantity measurement and have low efficiency.Integrating multiple types of existing measuring instruments, there are common problems such as single measurement, low efficiency, and bulkiness.The instrument of this project will create a precedent for the integration of spectral material, 2D/3D vision, and temperature/stress measurement before and after the molten pool is solidified.

# Six-rotor unmanned helicopter

The six-rotor unmanned helicopter is from DJI and the model is M600. M600 provides rich set of instructions for UAV control, and can be controlled to performs various tasks.

# Imaging module

To work on both daytime and night, the IRS UAV is equipped with a digital camera and a thermal imager. The digital camera is competent for most of the scenes on daytime, and when it comes to night, the thermal imager can be used to find anomaly targets. Besides, the aligned digital camera and a thermal imager can be used as a multispectral imager for more information.

# Onboard computing platform

For online real-time reconnaissance and reaction, the data processing is onboard. The onboard computing platform is NVIDIA JETSON TX2, where we perform detection and tracking agrithms.
